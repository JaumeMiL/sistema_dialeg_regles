# Rule-Based Dialogue System Project 🏡💬

**Applied to Housing Sales and Rentals**

## Overview 📑

This project develops a rule-based dialogue system to assist users in finding housing that matches their preferences. It uses data in JSON format to store housing options and interacts with the user through a chatbot that responds smoothly, managing incorrect or incomplete answers.

## Features 🛠️

- **Response Handling**: Manages user input errors and includes the `k_to_number` function to handle numbers expressed in thousands (like "30k").
- **User Options**: Allows the use of keywords `any`, `quit`, and `return` for flexible interaction with the system.
- **Database Expansion**: Includes more than 40 available houses with variations in questions to make the conversation more human-like.
- **Advanced Housing Filter**: Recommends houses that meet the indicated preferences or improve certain requirements set by the user.

## Execution 🚀

To run the system:

1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (pandas, ipywidgets).
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook file `P1_TVD_Marta_Jaume_Abril.ipynb` to start the chatbot and interact with the recommendation system.

## Key Results 🔍

- **Smooth Interaction**: The chatbot can handle incomplete responses and ask for clarifications when needed, ensuring a more natural user experience.
- **Choice Confirmations**: Users can review and modify their answers using the `return` option.
- **Database Enhancements**: Several expansions and variations in questions to make the interaction more human-like and avoid monotony.

## Conclusion 📝

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of rule-based dialogue systems in offering personalized housing recommendations. Features have been added to make the interaction more realistic and give users more control over the conversation.
